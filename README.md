# d878uv
This is my codeplug for Anytone D878UV Plus.

ItÂ´s based on SM0RUX (https://github.com/sm0rux/at-d878uv) great work with all SM-repeaters, and with adaptions and add-ons for my specific needs.

CPS version 3.04 and firmware version 3.04 are used.
Band mode is set to "Commercial Europe Mode:00000".

You will have to add your callsign and DMR-id in Radio ID list and APRS.
